# Project_SC

**Secure Coding**

Objective:
Learn and practice OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities. CTFs on successful exploitation, we were also supposed to fix that vulnerability. We were asked to build a web application. 
We were supposed to do Web Penetration Test on other student web application. Provide a detailed report on the pentesting done and the vulnerabilities found. We were also asked to link the identified weakness with their respective weakness.

Conclusion:
Developed a web application from scratch using C# and .NET Framework. Performed attack labs where we exploited a vulnerable application. Performed defense labs where we fixed the vulnerabilities in the code and made it secure. 
Analysed and found vulnerabilities in an another student application and reported it, associated each found vulnerability with a CWE.
